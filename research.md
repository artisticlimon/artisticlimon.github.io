+ *Use of Machine Learning Models for the Forecast of Extreme River Flows (Maximum and Minimum)*: for this project, I am implementing Random Forest and Neural Network models using both Python and R. I am contributing specifically on the forecast of maximum flows.

+ *Influence of Coffee Management Practices on the Accumulation Pattern of Bioactive Compounds in Fruits and Leaves of Coffee (Coffea arabica L.): An Innovative Mathematical Model Based on Soil Properties, Microbial Community Composition, and Plant Physiology*: my contribution to this interdisciplinary project consists on the calibration of various machine learning models to predict soil biodiversity. I will be presenting our work at the virtual [2025 IDWSD Conference](https://www.idwsds.org/).
